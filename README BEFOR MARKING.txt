PLEASE NOTE::
The program will compile but crash initially, this is because I cannot get local-file reading to work.

In the World.cpp file there is a static string named “path”, please replace this with the relevant path. The program will now work if this is correct.

TO PLAY::
Use WASD or Arrow keys to move.
The Red bar at the top is your JetPack Fuel
The Green bar is your health
Hold the Left Mouse Button to shoot, the bullets will go towards your mouse

The terrain is destructible, dirt is easier to destroy than stone

Enemies will respawn instantly on death, this is a score based game (see top right)

There can only be 10 bullets on screen at one time

Items will drop on random, there’s health, high JetPackFuel capacity and double damage
